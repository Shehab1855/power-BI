# Practical Task Report - Power BI Project

## Overview
This Power BI project demonstrates the application of various data manipulation and visualization techniques. The dataset used contains two tables with at least five columns each, including numeric and date columns. The project involves combining the tables, modifying data types, creating new columns, and visualizing the data through various charts.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of two tables in an Excel or CSV file format. The tables include the following characteristics:
- At least five columns each
- Numeric columns
- Date column

## Data Preparation and Transformation
The following changes and transformations were applied to the dataset using Power BI:
1. **Combine Tables**: The two tables were combined into one.
2. **Change Data Type**: Decimal columns were converted to integers. In the absence of decimal columns, text columns were converted to UPPER or LOWER case.
3. **Date Column Transformation**: The Date column was split into three new columns named "Year," "Month," and "Day."
4. **New Calculated Column**: A new column was added with a meaningful calculation based on existing numeric columns.
5. **Merge Columns**: Two columns were merged into a new column.

## Data Visualization
The project includes a report with the following visualizations:
- **Page 1**:
  - Bar Chart
  - Pie Chart
- **Page 2**:
  - Line Chart

### Additional Features
- Renamed report pages to "Task Page 1" and "Task Page 2."
- Added a report title: "Practical Task Report."
- Applied a report-level filter using Basic Filtering.
- Added a slicer on the second page.
- Created a custom measure using the SUM function and incorporated it into a chart.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. **Data Import**: Import the provided dataset into Power BI.
2. **Combine Tables**: Use the "Merge Queries" feature to combine the two tables.
3. **Change Data Type**: Change the data type of any decimal columns to integers or modify text columns to UPPER or LOWER case.
4. **Transform Date Column**: Split the Date column into Year, Month, and Day.
5. **Create Calculated Columns**: Add a new column with a meaningful calculation and another new column by merging two existing columns.
6. **Create Visualizations**: 
   - On the first page, create a Bar Chart and a Pie Chart.
   - On the second page, create a Line Chart.
7. **Apply Filters and Slicers**: Add a report-level filter and a slicer on the second page.
8. **Create Measure**: Write a DAX formula to create a custom measure using the SUM function.
9. **Save Report**: Save the final report as a PDF file.

## Usage
1. Open the Power BI project file.
2. Navigate through the pages to view the visualizations.
3. Interact with the filters and slicers to explore the data further.
4. Review the custom measure used in the charts for additional insights.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of Power BI in data transformation and visualization. By following the steps outlined above, users can replicate the process and gain insights from their datasets.
